Installation:
clone or download this repository ( or if you dont know how, click here: https://github.com/NullNRG/Muck-BepInEx/archive/refs/heads/main.zip ), 

copy all the files from the "Muck-BepInEx-main" folder in the archive, into the root of the Muck game directory.
if it asks to replace any files, yeah, do that. if it's a fresh install, shouldnt need to.

  ex: "your steam installation path"\steamapps\common\Muck

run Muck.

Plugins are located in BepInEx\plugins
Plugin config files (if plugin supports it ) in BepInEx\config

By default, i have included a plugin that gives you god mode. if you dont want it, delete the MuckGod plugin.
For any plugins, if you wish to delete any, just remove them from the "\BepInEx\plugins\" folder.
I will also provide some plugins here: https://github.com/NullNRG/Muck-BepInEx-Plugins 

put the plugins in the "\BepinEx\plugins\" folder.

By default, i have included some plugins from their respective authors,
to create these publicised assemblies for you, when you first launch the game with BepInEx installed.
