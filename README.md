# Muck-BepInEx

Installation:
clone or download this repository ( or if you dont know how, click here: https://github.com/NullNRG/Muck-BepInEx/archive/refs/heads/main.zip ), 

copy all the files from the "Muck-BepInEx-main" folder in the archive, into the root of the Muck game directory.
if it asks to replace any files, yeah, do that. if it's a fresh install, shouldnt need to.

ex: "your steam installation path"\steamapps\common\Muck

run Muck.

Plugins are located in BepInEx\plugins
Plugin config files (if plugin supports it ) in BepInEx\config

I will upload a Visual Studio Template to create your own mods.

Last but not least,



Muck..
